Handling the delivery preparations for a new vessel is no small task, especially during a pandemic. With the strong support from the shipowners, SWAN was able to successfully overcome many of the unusual challenges faced prior to and during the delivery.

The 7,500 cbm gas carrier is set to trade around the Caribbean. She is under the careful command of one of Swan Shipping Corp's finest Masters, Captain Vicente Flores, Jr.`,

    content: `On 19th of March 2021, SWAN Shipping Corporation welcomed a newbuilding into its growing fleet. A 3,500 cbm gas carrier, SASANQUA was built by Sasaki Shipbuilding in Hiroshima, Japan. Making this whole venture possible was the unending trust and support of its shipowner, the Shintoku Kaiun.

Despite years of not having ships to manage for the good shipowners, the relationship between the two companies did not fade. For Swan, managing SASANQUA only makes the already strong relationship stronger and will further drive its commitment to provide quality and trustworthy service to Shintoku Kaiun, and to the rest of its shipowners.

The delivery of the SASANQUA happened at a difficult time during the COVID-19 pandemic. But with years of experience, and the strong support of the shipowners, Swan was able to safely provide the competent manpower well ahead of the scheduled delivery date, without undue delays.

To date, SASANQUA has been sailing smoothly under the command of one of Swan Shipping Corp's finest Masters, Captain Roberto Pueyo.`,

The quality system developed during the certification process will guide the company to meet its set goals as well as improve overall operations by clearly defining every aspect of the company from the top of each department down.

Along with the quality system, new processes were developed as well as further definition and fleshing-out of each department's roles and to ensure the effectiveness of the company. The ISO 9001 certification, however, is not the end of the journey however, this only marks the beginning of the company's journey into solidifying its promise of quality service for all its customers. Further audits will be had to ensure the company's compliance, and to guide the quality management to guide them, and the quality management system. SWAN will be prepared to wield and solidify its promise to improve.`,

    excerpt: "Deciding whether to go with a large or small company is among the many considerations a seafarer takes in an employer.",
    content: `Deciding whether to go with a large or small company is among the many considerations a seafarer takes in an employer. In the Philippines, some mariners are known to "shop around" ship management companies and manning agencies in hopes of finding a competitive salary. For the past years, however, the job-hunting scale slowly weighed towards the security of tenure and shipboard safety — something that smaller companies can provide just as well as their bigger and more prominent counterparts can.

"A small company could do the same job as the big players in the industry; same services but for a more cost-effective and efficient way," Salas remarked Racquelito "Bong" Salas, president of Swan Shipping Corporation, witnessed this shift in a three-decade career in ship management.

The ship management veteran personally observed such feats in conversations with industry leaders, noting that the best practices and experiences of larger companies are similar to the smaller ones.

"What I enjoy most is meeting other people from the industry through forums and conferences. They openly share their knowledge and experiences in manning and ship management. Consequently, I've learned that the struggles are the same and I am proud that a small company such as ours could match theirs," Salas said.

Salas entered his first job in ship troubleshooting and improving things he could get his hands on. He is constantly able to hold the scale of seafarer employment and retention by aligning it with the needs of shipowners and operators through SWAN.

"I am responsible for our 'Goal Zero' – to achieve zero accidents, no harm to our people, and zero oil spill at sea. To do this, our shore staff and seafarers are trained to be 'switched on' in terms of regulations," Salas disclosed.

The Swan Shipping president disclosed that among the many difficulties in ship management is implementing and keeping all personnel, both onshore and at sea, abreast of the constantly changing regulations promulgated around the world by different flag States and the maritime industry.

"Shipping is a very dynamic industry where rules and regulations can change overnight. Regardless of our size as a company, however, we safeguard the welfare of our crew, the environment, and our Owner's investment," Salas underscored.

Nothing is too difficult for Salas. Not even the relentless fluctuations in shipping trends and regulations. Such resilience is attributed to the privations he experienced as a child.

"I am the eldest of eight children and my parents were both accountants, so money was a bit housewife. Our financial insufficiency taught me and my siblings the value of hard work and a sense of gratitude for whatever it is we have on our table, no matter how little it is," Salas recalled. "My mother raised us with a strong sense of religion and spirituality, accountability, and determination came to him before adulthood.

When he entered college, Salas recalled that life was not all bed of roses nor was it a housewife. Our financial insufficiency taught me and my siblings the value of hard work and a sense of gratitude for whatever it is we have on our table, no matter how little it is," Salas recalled. "My mother raised us with a strong sense of religion and spirituality, accountability, and determination came to him before adulthood.

Behind the strong-willed character, is a man of music. The rigidity of shipping is washed off by the fluid filling of melodies from vinyl records he kept as a young man.

"I used to play with a band. I can do the guitar, bass, and keyboard but what I love best is playing the drums," he shared.

Salas is also tagged as the "bonding agent" of his friends and family for his ability to reach out and unite people. "Before the pandemic, I'm almost always in-charge of organizing reunions. It can be difficult to get people together but it is what I enjoy," he concluded.`,
